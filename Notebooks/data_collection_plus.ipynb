    "# Road Following Data Collection - PLUS v2.0\n",
    "Author: George Gorospe\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: this code draws heavily on the NVIDIA data_collection.ipynb notebook shipped with the Jetbot sold by Sparkfun.com.\n",
    "You can find the original code here: https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, our goal is to enable our Jetbot to follow a road designated by a lane or limits on the left and right of the road. This is similar to line following. However, unlike line following, no lines are made for the robot, the Jetbot will now have to adapt to its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially you'll be teaching your Jetbot how to drive while staying inside the limits of the road or path. To do this, lets consider what type of data we need to collect...\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our Jetbot to know how to steer given its position on the road or track.\n",
    "So we'll need many photos and steering angles guiding the robot to a safe trajectory or path at various points in the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to control the Jetbot, commanding it to move along the road, while we collect data (photos) and viable path data (x and y coordinates). That can be later used to train a machine learning model. In this case, we're training the model to steer for us. Let's get started!"

    "In this notebook, we'll do the same exact thing! Except, instead of classification, you'll learn a different fundamental technique, regression, that we'll use to enable JetBot to follow a road (or really, any path or target point).\n",
    "\n",
    "Place the JetBot in different positions on a path (offset from center, different angles, etc)\n",

    "Using a gamepad controller, place a 'green dot', which corresponds to the target direction we want the robot to travel, on the image.\n",
    "Store the X, Y values of this green dot along with the image from the robot's camera\n",
    "Then, in the training notebook, we'll train a neural network to predict the X, Y values of our label. In the live demo, we'll use the predicted X, Y values to compute an approximate steering value (it's not 'exactly' an angle, as that would require image calibration, but it's roughly proportional to the angle so our controller will work fine).\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you decide exactly where to place the target for this example? Here is a guide we think may help\n",

    "\n",
    "The robot can safely travel directly towards the target (without going out of bounds etc.)\n",
    "The target will continuously progress along our imagined path\n",
    "What we get, is a 'carrot on a stick' that moves along our desired trajectory. Deep learning decides where to place the carrot, and JetBot just follows it :)"
