    "# Road Following Data Collection - PLUS v2.0\n",
    "Author: George Gorospe\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: this code draws hevily from the NVIDIA data_collection.ipynb notebook shipped with the Jetbot sold by Sparkfun.com.\n",
    "You can find the original code here: https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot\n",
    "\n",
    "Now becoming more familiar with your Jetbot, no doubt you've found that data collection is very important and also somewhat time consuming. Many companies working on self-driving cars employ people who drive their cars all day simply to collect data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, our goal is to enable our Jetbot to follow a road designated by a lane or limits on the left and right of the road. This is similar to line following. However, unlike line following, no lines are made for the robot, the Jetbot will now have to adapt to its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially you'll be teaching your Jetbot how to drive while staying inside the limits of the road or path. To do this, lets consider what type of data we need to collect...\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our Jetbot to know how to steer given its position on the road or track.\n",
    "So we'll need many photos and steering angles guiding the robot to a safe trajectory or path at various points in the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to control the Jetbot, commanding it to move along the road, while we collect data (photos) and viable path data (x and y coordinates). That can be later used to train a machine learning model. In this case, we're training the model to steer for us. Let's get started!"
